CS 205 Project 1 & 2reflection

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis financial is a financial company that wants to improve their web application's security. Specifically, they wanted to know about the current security vulnerabilities they were experiencing and a plan for mitigating these  vulnerabilities.

What did you do very well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall wellbeing?

When I found my client's security vulnerabilities, I had to interpret each of them to better understand what issues they were facing. It is important to code securely to make sure that private data isn't being intercepted by malicious people. Software security adds to a company's overall wellbeing by making the program safe and secure for its the company's customers.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The database linked with each of the CVE codes was very helpful to me. It was very helpful because it was able to inform me more about what each code meant as well as possible fixes for each issue.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by implementing an encryption algorithm for a checksum and generating a self-signed certificate to allow the application to run with HTTPS protocol. In the future, I will use my resources and other people encountering similar vulnerabilities to aid my mitigation techniques.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

After refactoring the code, I ran the dependency check again to make sure that there were no new vulnerabilities. If there were, I had to alter my code and test again until no new vulnerabilities were found.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using defensive programining practices and error handling helped in this project. Sometimes I ran into errors and needed to figure out why. Employing these practices helped me narrow down what was going wrong.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I can show future employers that I have adequate and safe programming practices as well as general knowledge of encryption algorithms and HTTPS protocols.








CS 320 Software Automation and Testing final project reflection:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by conducting constant tests as I am developing my code. Testing code is important to developing any project because it helps developer stay on track. Something may not be working as intended and if the code is not being regularly tested, these errors can go unnoticed. This can cause many issues including customer dissatisfaction with the product which can cost the companies developing the product large amounts of money and integrity to go back and fix these issues.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program, it is important to understand what the customer really wants. It is also important to be adaptable to customer needs and wants. This can occurr a lot when working in an Agile work environment. Customer needs can change and shift, causing the developers to shift and change their code to align more with what the user wants. The user needs should be seen as the goals and guidlines when developing the project. It is important to keep these needs and wants in mind when developing features for the product.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I first look at what the what the major goals for the software are. Then I like to break up the project into smaller tasks that will eventually build up towards meeting these goals. When I actually get into coding, I am constantly testing the code that I write. If I feel like I haven't tested my code in a while, it is probably time to test it. I avoid coding large blocks of code at a time because it makes testing that portion take much longer. In addition, if there are errors within that block of code, it can be harder to pick out and find out exactly what is going wrong.
