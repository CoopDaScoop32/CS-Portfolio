CS 320 Software Automation and Testing final project reflection:

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by conducting constant tests as I am developing my code. Testing code is important to developing any project because it helps developer stay on track. Something may not be working as intended and if the code is not being regularly tested, these errors can go unnoticed. This can cause many issues including customer dissatisfaction with the product which can cost the companies developing the product large amounts of money and integrity to go back and fix these issues.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When interpreting user needs and incorporating them into a program, it is important to understand what the customer really wants. It is also important to be adaptable to customer needs and wants. This can occurr a lot when working in an Agile work environment. Customer needs can change and shift, causing the developers to shift and change their code to align more with what the user wants. The user needs should be seen as the goals and guidlines when developing the project. It is important to keep these needs and wants in mind when developing features for the product.

How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I first look at what the what the major goals for the software are. Then I like to break up the project into smaller tasks that will eventually build up towards meeting these goals. When I actually get into coding, I am constantly testing the code that I write. If I feel like I haven't tested my code in a while, it is probably time to test it. I avoid coding large blocks of code at a time because it makes testing that portion take much longer. In addition, if there are errors within that block of code, it can be harder to pick out and find out exactly what is going wrong.
